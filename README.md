Bowling Challenge
=================
This is a weekend exercise suggested by Makers Academy. 

It is an small program that calculates the score of a bowling game.

I did 3 different versions, the [last](https://github.com/gerard-morera/bowling-challenge/blob/master/src/GetScore.js) one using a functional approach to the problem.

## Technologies used

Javascript, Jasmine
